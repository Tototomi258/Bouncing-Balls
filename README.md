# 02- [ ]balls

## Description

## TODO
- [x] new balls should be generated when the use clicks and drags the mouse
- [x] the speed of the balls should depend on the speed of the mouse movement
- [x] the direction of the balls should depend on the direction of motion of the mouse
- [x] the balls should bounce at the edges of the container
- [x] scrollbars should not appear when the balls hit the edges of the container
- [ ] the ball movement should have some physicality (wight, gravity, speed)
- [ ] it should be possible to 'freeze' and 'resume' the animation
- [ ] the user should be able to choose the 'skin' of the balls, colors, images, etc
- [x] the user should be able to make the balls bigger or smaller with keyboard shortcuts
and onscreen buttons
- [ ] the user should be able to remove balls (e.g. by clicking on them or on a button)
- [ ] the user should be able to to increase/decrease the speed of balls with keyboard
shortcuts and onscreen buttons
- [x] the page should be page responsive, meaning that when the user changes the size of the
page, the balls never go out of their container and all page controls are repositioned to fit
the viewport
- [ ] add an onscreen counter that displays the current number of balls
